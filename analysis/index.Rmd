# Optimizers group results

## Objectives:

1. Provide a feasible plan of Variety Development Process with four years
length for the NextGen Cassava Partners;

2. Optimize the Breeding program costs per stage;

3. Predict the best progenies to optimize crosses activities costs and genetic gain per recurrent selection cycle.

Marnin and I separate the project in two branches:
